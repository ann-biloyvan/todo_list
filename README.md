# About the project

This is a small responsive app to add and store your tasks. Besides adding tasks, a user can:

1. mark a task as completed;
2. sort tasks by name and date;
3. remove a task from the list.

All tasks and their completion status are stored in local storage, so a user can safely reload the page without losing any data.

If there's no tasks yet, special information is provided.
